A platform-agnostic MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for LLM observability, supporting platforms like LangSmith and Langfuse. It runs **both** transport protocols simultaneously: `streamable-http` (for Cursor) and `SSE` (for Windsurf) using FastMCP 2.0.

## Features

- üîÑ Support for multiple tracing platforms through a unified interface
- üõ†Ô∏è MCP tools for retrieving and analyzing traces
- üìä Trace comparison across different platforms
- üöÄ **Dual transport support**: Runs both `streamable-http` and `SSE` simultaneously
- üì° **Cursor compatibility**: `streamable-http` transport on port 52734
- üåä **Windsurf compatibility**: `SSE` transport on port 52735
- ü§ñ **Claude Code compatibility**: Full MCP integration support
- üß© Easy integration with LangSmith and LangFuse
- üîß Use multiple clients at the same time with one server

## Quick Start (for End Users)

This guide provides the quickest way to get the TraceNexus server up and running.

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+ (developed with 3.11)

### 2. Installation

1.  **(Optional but Recommended)** Create a dedicated directory and set up a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    mkdir ~/my_tracenexus_server
    cd ~/my_tracenexus_server
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

2.  Install TraceNexus from PyPI:
    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade tracenexus
    ```

### 3. Configuration (API Keys & Settings)

TraceNexus requires API keys for the tracing platforms it supports (e.g., LangSmith, Langfuse).

- Create a `.env` file in your project directory (e.g., `~/my_tracenexus_server/.env` if you followed the optional step above, or in the directory where you run `tracenexus`).
- Add your API keys and desired default platform to this file. The server automatically loads these settings on startup.

**Example `.env` file:**

```env
# LangSmith Configuration - Multiple Instances Support
# Comma-separated API keys for different LangSmith workspaces/projects
LANGSMITH_API_KEYS="prod-api-key,dev-api-key,test-api-key"
# Names for each instance (will be used in tool names)
LANGSMITH_NAMES="prod,dev,test"
# This creates tools: langsmith_prod_get_trace, langsmith_dev_get_trace, langsmith_test_get_trace

# Langfuse Configuration - Multiple Instances Support
# Comma-separated configuration for different Langfuse projects/environments
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEYS="pub-key-1,pub-key-2,pub-key-3"
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEYS="secret-key-1,secret-key-2,secret-key-3"
LANGFUSE_HOSTS="https://cloud.langfuse.com,https://cloud.langfuse.com,https://self-hosted.example.com"
# Names for each instance (will be used in tool names)
LANGFUSE_NAMES="prod,dev,test"
# This creates tools: langfuse_prod_get_trace, langfuse_dev_get_trace, langfuse_test_get_trace
```

**Note:** 
- For LangSmith: The number of names should match the number of API keys
- For Langfuse: The number of public keys, secret keys, hosts, and names should all match
- If names are not provided or don't match, auto-generated names (instance1, instance2, etc.) will be used

Refer to `tracenexus/cli.py` (if installed from source) or use `tracenexus --help` for details on how provider-specific API keys are checked at startup.

### 4. Running the Server

Once installed and configured, run the server using:
```bash
tracenexus
```

This will start **both transport protocols simultaneously**:
- **üì° Streamable-HTTP** (Cursor): `http://localhost:52734/mcp`
- **üåä SSE** (Windsurf): `http://localhost:52735/sse`

To see all available command-line options, including changing ports:
```bash
tracenexus --help
```

**Custom ports example:**
```bash
tracenexus --http-port 8000 --sse-port 8001
```

### 5. Using with MCP Client Applications

TraceNexus runs both transport protocols simultaneously, so you can use **Claude Code, Cursor, and Windsurf at the same time**!

#### For Claude Code

1. **Follow steps 1-3 from the Quick Start section above** to install TraceNexus and set up your `.env` file with API keys.

2. **Start the TraceNexus server:**
   ```bash
   tracenexus
   ```

3. **Add TraceNexus to Claude Code using the CLI:**
   ```bash
   # Recommended: Use streamable-http transport for better stability
   claude mcp add tracenexus --transport streamable-http --url http://localhost:52734/mcp
   
   # Alternative: SSE transport (may have initialization issues)
   # claude mcp add tracenexus --transport sse --url http://localhost:52735/sse
   ```

That's it! Claude Code can now use the trace retrieval tools. Tool names follow the pattern `langsmith_<instance_name>_get_trace` and `langfuse_<instance_name>_get_trace` where instance names come from your configuration (with dashes converted to underscores).

To verify it's working, you can ask Claude: "What MCP tools do you have available?"

#### For Cursor (Streamable-HTTP)

1.  Ensure the TraceNexus server is running (e.g., via `tracenexus`).
2.  In Cursor's MCP server settings, add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tracenexus": {
      "transport": "streamable-http",
      "url": "http://localhost:52734/mcp" 
    }
  }
}
```

#### For Windsurf (SSE)

1.  Ensure the TraceNexus server is running (e.g., via `tracenexus`).
2.  In Windsurf's MCP server settings, add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tracenexus": {
      "serverUrl": "http://localhost:52735/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: Both configurations can be used simultaneously with the same server instance!

## Available Tools

Once running, the server exposes the following MCP tools:

### LangSmith Tools (Multiple Instances)
-   **`langsmith_<name>_get_trace`**: Retrieve a single trace by ID from a specific LangSmith instance
    - Example: `langsmith_prod_get_trace`, `langsmith_dev_get_trace`, `langsmith_test_get_trace`
    - The actual tool names depend on your `LANGSMITH_NAMES` configuration

### Langfuse Tools (Multiple Instances)
-   **`langfuse_<name>_get_trace`**: Retrieve a single trace by ID from a specific Langfuse instance
    - Example: `langfuse_prod_get_trace`, `langfuse_dev_get_trace`, `langfuse_test_get_trace`
    - The actual tool names depend on your `LANGFUSE_NAMES` configuration

An example Python client showing how to connect and use these tools can be found in `examples/client.py`.

## Development Setup

If you want to contribute to TraceNexus, modify the source code, or run it directly from a cloned repository, follow these steps.

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+ (developed with 3.11)
- Poetry (for dependency management)

### 2. Installation & Setup (from Source)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sharrajesh/tracenexus.git
cd tracenexus

# Install dependencies (including development dependencies)
make install-dev
# or poetry install --with dev
```

### 3. Configuration
Follow the same `.env` file configuration steps outlined in "Quick Start (for End Users) -> 3. Configuration". Place the `.env` file in the root of the cloned `tracenexus` directory.

### 4. Running the Server (from Source)

```bash
# Run the TraceNexus server (runs both transports: HTTP on 52734, SSE on 52735)
make run
```
This uses `poetry run tracenexus`. You can also run `poetry run tracenexus --help` for options.

## Development

- **Formatting, Linting & Type Checking**: `make format` (uses `isort` and `black` to reformat code, `ruff` to check and auto-fix linting issues, and `mypy` for type checking).
- **Tests**: `make test`
