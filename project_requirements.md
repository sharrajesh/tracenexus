# Project Requirements

## Overall Goals

- [ ] Easily enable getting traces (observability traces from LLMs or other sources) to enrich the debugging experience. These traces could be exposed over MCP-like protocols to make finding bugs in applications easier.

## Key Features

- [ ] **Feature 1:** Langsmith LLM observability over MCP server

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** *(N/A for now, or to be determined if a UI is needed later)*
- **Backend:** Python (using Poetry for dependency management)
- **Database:** *(To be determined if needed; likely not for a core library focused on data transit)*
- **Deployment:** *(To be determined; could be a library import or a standalone server process)*
- **Version Control:** Git
- **Other Tools:** *e.g., Linters (Flake8, Pylint), Formatters (Black), Testing frameworks (pytest)*
